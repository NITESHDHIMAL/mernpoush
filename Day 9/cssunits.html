      <p>
        Nepal’s IT and ICT sector <span>importent</span>  is steadily growing as a contributor to the
        national economy. In 2022, ICT services (including IT outsourcing,
        software, and BPO) accounted for ≈1.7% of Nepal’s nominal GDP and added
        roughly +0.3 percentage points to annual real GDP growth between 2012
        and 2024. The sector’s export performance is notable: IT service exports
        reached USD 515 million (≈ NPR 67.5 billion) in 2022, representing ≈1.4%
        of GDP and contributing about 5.5% of Nepal’s foreign exchange reserves.
        Over the past two decades, digitally delivered services have grown at a
        CAGR of ~11.6%, and by 2023, they accounted for over 50% of Nepal’s
        total services exports. (source)
